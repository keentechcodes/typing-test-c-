The slush lay deep along the street.
A wisp of cloud hung in the blue air.
A pound of sugar costs more than eggs.
The fin was sharp and cut the clear water.

The term ended in late June that year.
A tusk is used to make costly gifts.
Ten pins were set in order.
The bill as paid every third week.
